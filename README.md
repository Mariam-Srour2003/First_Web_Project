# My First Web Project

This repository contains my first web project submitted for the university course CSCI315: Web Application Development.

## Project Details:

- **Languages Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- **Project Directory:** `PROJECT/`

## Description:

This project represents my initial attempt at web development. As my first project, it has its limitations, and I acknowledge that there are areas for improvement. During the development process, I faced challenges, and being unfamiliar with helpful CSS or website resources affected the project's design.

I consider this project as a valuable learning experience, and I look forward to applying the knowledge gained to enhance my future web development projects.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback!
